Detecting the key facial points is needed to detect the key points on the face. The dataset mentioned above consists of all the X and Y coordinates of each and every key point on the face. To the given data set we add more points this can be done by flipping the image on x axis, flipping the image on the y axis and by incresing the brightness of the image. We do this because more the data set the better the efficiency. To build the neural network we use the the concept of Residual Neural Networks also known as ResNet. The flowchart above shows the howthe neural network is built. The link for the datset is https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/overview
